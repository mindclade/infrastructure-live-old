# Mindclade security policy · `infrastructure-live`

| Document control | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Mindclade Security |
| Version | 1.0 |

| Repository scope | Live GCP infrastructure and sensitive Terraform state |

**Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.**

| Channel | For |
|---|---|
| [Private security advisory](https://github.com/mindclade/infrastructure-live/security/advisories/new) | Anything in this repository. Preferred |
| `security@mindclade.com` | Reports that cannot be submitted through GitHub; ordinary email is not end-to-end encrypted |
| `biosecurity@mindclade.com` | Screening bypasses, unsafe model behavior |

The canonical policy targets acknowledgement within 2 business days and triage
within 5. Those are operational targets, not contractual service levels. Safe
harbor applies only within the canonical scope and does not authorize
third-party systems or data, promise a bounty, or excuse unlawful conduct.

**The full policy — scope, response targets, encryption guidance, and safe-harbor text — is the canonical one:**
[`mindclade/.github/SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/mindclade/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

This file exists because the `.github` repo is **internal**, and GitHub only inherits
community health files from a *public* one. Nothing is inherited here, so every repository
carries its own. Deliberately short — a duplicated hundred-line policy goes stale in every
copy but one.

## Specific to `infrastructure-live`

Terraform state for this repository contains every value marked sensitive across the live estate, in plaintext. Never paste plan output containing state into an issue, a PR, or a chat message.

Never commit credentials, private keys, production configuration, customer data, model
weights, or restricted biological sequences. The `push-blocklist` org ruleset rejects the
common shapes at push time, before the object reaches a branch — but it is not exhaustive.

If you commit a secret, **rotate it first**, then clean the history. Rewriting history is not
remediation: the value was already exposed to every clone, fetch, and webhook subscriber.

## Proprietary header policy

First-party configuration and policy files in this repository use a shared comment header block.
It is defined once in `.github/MINDCLADE_PROPRIETARY_SOURCE_HEADER.txt`:

```text
# Copyright © 2026 Mindclade, LLC. All Rights Reserved.
# Mindclade Proprietary and Confidential.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Mindclade-Proprietary

```

The pre-commit hook enforces this header automatically:

```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files mindclade-license-header
```

These checks intentionally skip generated/lock artifacts (`rendered/`, `.terraform/`,
`.terragrunt-cache/`, and `*.lock.hcl`).
